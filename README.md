# novelEnsemble
An ensemble algorithm developed for defect prediction data sets

This algorithm was developed based on triTraining. triTraining utilizes classification error.
Instead, novelENsemble employs some metrics indicating defectiveness of a software.

The algorithm was established on R and C# codes.


In Tuning.cs, "public string dataPath = Resources.Resource1.xalan_2_4;" determines the data set to be exploited in ensemble learning process.
